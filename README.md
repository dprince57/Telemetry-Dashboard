A hopeful attempt at building a working race car simulator with real physics.
Maybe this gets me hired, maybe not, but its fun either way!


TODO:
	Load track and weather.
	Load a car, with spec and downforce profiles,
	Load a driver profile(maybe something along the lines of g-forces they an handle,
			      or likely hood they brake early.)
	Run cars on track
	Run cars on track and hacve physics alter them.
	Systems engineering like engine temps, tire wear, gforce loads, and overshoot
	Have the engine degrade and be saved, load a state later to see if it fails.
