name: "Michelin GT3 Slick Medium"
units: "SI"

# Base friction level at reference load & optimal temp
mu_peak_ref: 1.55
mu_slide_ref: 1.30          # sliding friction when over the peak

# Reference normal load (per tire) where mu_peak_ref applies
Fz_ref_N: 3500

# Load sensitivity: mu decreases as load increases
load_sensitivity:
  k_mu: 0.12                 # higher = more drop with load

# Lateral force shape vs slip angle (radians)
lateral:
  C_alpha_ref: 90000         # N/rad at Fz_ref
  shape_k: 3.5               # saturation sharpness
  peak_slip_rad: 0.09        # ~5.2 degrees

# Longitudinal force shape vs slip ratio
longitudinal:
  C_kappa_ref: 110000        # N per slip (approx)
  shape_k: 4.0
  peak_slip: 0.11

# Temperature model (very simplified)
temperature:
  optimal_C: 95
  cold_C: 40
  hot_C: 125
  grip_drop_cold: 0.20       # lose up to 20% when cold
  grip_drop_hot: 0.25        # lose up to 25% when overheated

# Wear model
wear:
  mu_drop_at_full_wear: 0.30 # 30% loss at wear=1.0

# Rolling resistance (optional)
rr:
  Crr: 0.015
